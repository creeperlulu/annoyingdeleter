# Annoying Deleter
### What is this?
This project came from a silly idea given by Orpheus the dinosaur, which is the mascot for Hack Club.
Orpheus asked me to create a program that deletes random letters in a text to make it look silly!

### How do I use it?
If you really want to use this program (which is really just a silly experiment), you just need Python and nothing else, because it only relies on the random lib! Simply launch the script with any version of Python :>

This project is pure silliness and was only made for fun! Don't take it too seriously.
